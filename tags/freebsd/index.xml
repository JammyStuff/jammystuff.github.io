In this part, I&amp;rsquo;ll install some of the software that I need and start on the configuration of the system.
Display Resolution When I bought this laptop, I opted for a variant with a QHD+ screen. In hindsight, I wish I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done that. While the HiDPI situation in Linux has improved over the past few years, the experience is still far from seamless, and the situation in Windows isn&amp;rsquo;t much better.</description></item><item><title>FreeBSD on XPS 13: Part 1</title><link>https://jammy.co/posts/2018/05/freebsd-on-xps-13-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 May 2018 23:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jammy.co/posts/2018/05/freebsd-on-xps-13-part-1/</guid><description>I like to think of myself as being fairly Operating System agnostic. At home, my main desktop runs macOS and my laptop runs OpenSUSE. At work, I develop software for a Debian-based network operating system and administer CentOS VMs on VMware hypervisors.
There are two gaps here though. I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly use Windows any more (other than still rocking a Windows Phone for work), and I&amp;rsquo;ve never really seriously used a BSD.</description></item></channel></rss>
