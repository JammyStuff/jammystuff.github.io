<section id=js-article class=p-article__body>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine I am working on a calendar app. I know that a lot of my users keep
their events in Google Calendar, so I need to make sure that I can retrieve
their events from Google, and send back the newly created ones. How does Google
know that my app is allowed to access a user&rsquo;s calendar?</p>
<p>As a user, when I go to <a href=https://calendar.google.com>https://calendar.google.com</a> I&rsquo;m asked to provide the
username and password for my Google Account. So maybe my calendar app should ask
the user for their Google Account credentials, and then use those credentials to
authenticate with Google. There&rsquo;s a couple of issues with this approach.
Firstly, I need to store the user&rsquo;s password somewhere. Secondly, those
credentials can be used to do much more than access events in Google Calendar.
The app – or anyone who has found where the app is storing the password – can
read the user&rsquo;s email, delete their files in Google Drive, or rent some movies
from Google Play.</p>
<p>This is where OAuth enters the picture. Instead of asking you for your Google
Account credentials, my app asks Google for access to your calendar events. Once
Google has confirmed that you are happy, my app is given a token that allows it
to access your calendar events and nothing else.</p>
<h2 id=oauth>OAuth</h2>
<p><a href=https://oauth.net>OAuth</a> is a collection of open standards that allow
applications to be authorized to access resources. The core specification, and
various extensions, are developed by the <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/oauth/about/>IETF OAuth Working
Group</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are 2 major versions of the core specification.</p>
<p><a href=https://oauth.net/core/1.0/>OAuth 1.0</a> was the original specification,
released in 2007. A session fixation flaw was discovered in OAuth 1.0, which led
to <a href=https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/>OAuth 1.0a</a> being released in 2009. Finally,
OAuth 1.0 was published as <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5849/>RFC 5849</a>
in 2010.</p>
<p>OAuth 2.0 (<a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6749/>RFC 6749</a>) is a backward
incompatible replacement for OAuth 1.0 designed to cover more use cases, be
more extensible, and be simpler for the client developer. It was released in
2012. <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1/>OAuth 2.1</a> is
currently in draft stage and is intended to consolidate OAuth 2.0 and a number
of its extensions into a single specification covering modern use-cases and
security best practices.</p>
<p>OAuth 1 is considered obsolete now, so for the rest of this series, assume I am
speaking about OAuth 2 unless specified otherwise.</p>
<h2 id=protocol-overview>Protocol Overview</h2>
<p>OAuth defines four roles:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Resource Owner</dt>
<dd>An entity that can grant access to a resource. In most cases, this essentially
means a user.</dd>
<dt>Client</dt>
<dd>An application that makes resource requests on behalf of the resource owner.
This could be a smartphone app, a desktop app, a web app, a smart speaker, etc.</dd>
<dt>Resource Server</dt>
<dd>The server hosting the resources.</dd>
<dt>Authorization Server</dt>
<dd>The server issuing access tokens to the client after authenticating the
resource owner.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the early days of OAuth implementations, the authorization server and
resource server would often be the same (or at least be operated by the same
organization). More recently, with the rise of <a href=https://www.okta.com/>Okta</a>,
<a href=https://auth0.com/>Auth0</a>, and similar services, the authorization server
tends to be separate and often purchased as a service.</p>
<p>There are four grant types included in the core specification: authorization
code, implicit, resource owner password credentials, and client credentials. The
protocol flow varies depending on which grant type is in use<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, but at a high
level, the flow looks like this:</p>
<p><img src=https://giga.jammy.co/file/giga-jammy-co/images/oauth-explained/protocol-flow.png alt="OAuth 2 protocolflow"></p>
<ol>
<li>When the client needs to access a resource, it sends an authorization request
to the authorization server. As part of the request, it includes the scope of
access that it is asking for.</li>
<li>The authorization server authenticates the resource owner. This will usually
be by presenting a log in page.</li>
<li>The authorization server gets the resource owner&rsquo;s consent for access to be
granted. This is usually done by presenting a page outlining the scope of
access that has been requested, allowing the access to be approved or denied.</li>
<li>The authorization server provides the client with an access token.</li>
<li>The client uses the access token to authenticate access to the resource on
the resource server.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=scope>Scope</h2>
<p>Scope is a key concept in OAuth: it defines the access a client is granted to
the resources of a resource owner. Using the calendar example, scope is what
allows the app to access calendar events, without being able to access other
resources in the Google Account. The app would request access with the
<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events</code> scope, which allows it to
create, read, update, and delete calendar events. However the app would not be
able to delete a file from Google Drive, as that would require the
<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</code> scope.</p>
<p>When performing the authorization request, the client provides a space-separated
list of scopes that are being requested in the <code>scope</code> parameter of the request.
For example, the following authorization request asks for the <code>read:photos</code> and
<code>write:photos</code> scopes<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>https://jammystuff.eu.auth0.com/authorize?
    response_type=code&amp;
    client_id=p1LJZfMDXrd2EEQp6oV77ASWuN9tlvsK&amp;
    redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.example.com%2Foauth%2Fcallback&amp;
    scope=read%3Aphotos%20write%3Aphotos&amp;
    audience=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.example.com
</code></pre><p>After the authorization server has authenticated the resource owner, it obtains
their consent for the client to access the requested scopes. The resource owner
might be given the option to provide their consent for individual scopes, or
they may need to accept or decline the entire request. In the screenshot below,
the resource owner has to accept or deny the entire request, they cannot allow
only read access:</p>
<p><img src=https://giga.jammy.co/file/giga-jammy-co/images/oauth-explained/consent-screen.png alt="OAuth consentscreen"></p>
<p>It is also possible for scopes to be denied based on the authorization server&rsquo;s
policy. For example, the authorization server might prevent a user from being
able to authorize a scope based on their role, or might prevent a particular
client from being authorized for a scope.</p>
<p>When a token is issued to a client, the token is tied to the authorized scopes.
This means that the token can only be used to perform actions allowed by the
scopes it has been granted.</p>
<h2 id=tokens>Tokens</h2>
<p>The end result of the authorization flow is that the client will be issued with
an access token. Alternatively, they may be issued with a pair of tokens, as
there are two types of tokens used within the OAuth protocol:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Access Token</dt>
<dd>An access token is used to authenticate access to a resource.</dd>
<dt>Refresh Token</dt>
<dd>A refresh token is used to obtain a new access token. For example, this could
be because the existing access token expired. Refresh tokens are optional, so an
authorization server will not always issue one.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id=access-tokens>Access Tokens</h3>
<p>An access token is a string used by a client to demonstrate to a resource server
that it is authorized to access a resource. The token type is specified in the
<code>token_type</code> parameter of the token response. This was done to allow for
different token types to be used, and the OAuth RFC even refers to a <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac/>MAC token
type</a>. However,
it looks like the MAC token type was abandoned and never got past the 5th draft.</p>
<p>In practice, the only token type that really sees any use is the other one
referred to in the OAuth RFC: <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6750/>bearer
tokens</a>. Put simply, a bearer token
is a shared secret. Anyone that knows the secret can use it to authenticate with
the resource server.</p>
<p>The OAuth core specification says that access tokens are usually opaque to the
client, meaning that their format should not be inferred and the resource server
and authentication server need to agree on how to determine their validity and
covered scope. Since the release of the core specification, a number of
extension specifications have come out of the OAuth working group to provide
standards-based approaches to this, including <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7662/>OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection
(RFC 7662)</a> and <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9068/>JSON Web Token (JWT)
Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens (RFC
9068)</a>.</p>
<h3 id=refresh-tokens>Refresh Tokens</h3>
<p>Section 5.1.5.3 of <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6819/>OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations (RFC
6819)</a> suggests that tokens should be
given a short expiration time. Most access tokens that you see will have a
lifetime of up to a few hours. While this will be fine for some use-cases (such
as a printing service accessing your photos to fulfil a print order), other
use-cases require longer term access. How do they deal with this?</p>
<p>One option is for the app to simply request authorization again. Authorization
servers will usually remember the consent that a resource owner has provided to
a particular client, so a follow-up authorization request won&rsquo;t show the consent
page. If the authorization server also offers &ldquo;Remember Me&rdquo; functionality, the
log in page will not be shown either. Putting this all together, if a client is
accessing a resource in response to an interactive request from the resource
owner, it is often possible to run through the authorization flow again without
any input from the resource owner.</p>
<p>The other option is to use a refresh token. The big advantage of refresh tokens
is they do not require the resource owner (or their browser) to be involved in
the process at all. Instead, when issuing an access token, an authorization
server has the option of also providing the client with a refresh token. Once
the access token has expired, the client can use the refresh token to request a
new access token directly from the authorization server.</p>
<p>In order to be useful, refresh tokens need to have a longer expiry than access
tokens. To mitigate some of the security implications of that, refresh tokens
are only used in flows where the tokens are provided directly to the client
(i.e. the implicit flow is out!). Additionally, using the refresh token requires
the client to authenticate with the authorization server. Finally, refresh
tokens are often only single use. If so, a new refresh token will also be
provided when a refresh token is used.</p>
<p>While it is often useful to be able to renew access tokens without the resource
owner being present, it does increase the damage that could be done if an
insecure client was breached. It is common for modern authorization server
implementations to only issue refresh tokens if they are explicitly requested
through an <code>offline_access</code> scope.</p>
<h2 id=client-types>Client Types</h2>
<p>Although the OAuth specification doesn&rsquo;t exclude the possibility of using
unregistered clients, the advent of extensions such as the <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7591/>OAuth 2.0 Dynamic
Client Registration Protocol (RFC
7591)</a> means this is very rarely
used, and clients will have been registered with the authorization server. As
part of that registration, they indicate their client type. The defined client
types are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Confidential</dt>
<dd>Clients that can keep their client credentials secret, or are able to securely
authenticate themselves by some other means.</dd>
<dt>Public</dt>
<dd>Clients that cannot securely authenticate themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The specification also outlines three client profiles. Most modern
implementations have four client profiles, and will have clients register under
one of those profiles:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Web Application</dt>
<dd>A &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; web application running server-side. These are confidential
clients as the client credentials are not exposed to users.</dd>
<dt>User-Agent-Based Application</dt>
<dd>An application running client side in a user-agent (a web browser). These are
public clients, and it is assumed they cannot protect their client credentials
or tokens from the resource owner.</dd>
<dt>Native Application</dt>
<dd>An app installed on a device used by the resource owner (e.g. smartphone apps,
desktop apps, etc). While it may initially seem that these would be confidential
clients, the resource owner could obtain the client credentials by grabbing them
out of memory, and the same credentials will be used on other installs. This
means they are considered public clients.</dd>
<dt>Machine to Machine Application</dt>
<dd>This isn&rsquo;t defined in the specification, but is called out as a separate
client profile in most authorization servers. Machine to machine applications
are confidential clients that perform operations on their own behalf rather than
a resource owner&rsquo;s. In other words, they will use the client credentials grant.</dd>
</dl>
<p>All clients are issued with a client identifier. All confidential clients are
issued with a client secret, although in practice public clients are usually
also issued with one. Authorization servers will often make decisions about
grant types that can be used and scopes that can be requested based on the
registered client type.</p>
<h2 id=endpoints>Endpoints</h2>
<p>The OAuth specification outlines two endpoints on the authorization server, and
one endpoint on the client.</p>
<h3 id=authorization-endpoint>Authorization Endpoint</h3>
<p>The authorization endpoint is an authorization server endpoint used to obtain
authorization from the resource owner via user-agent redirection. It is only
used by the authorization code and implicit grants. The way this endpoint is
used depends on the grant type being used, so it will be covered in the posts
for each grant type later in the series.</p>
<h3 id=redirection-endpoint>Redirection Endpoint</h3>
<p>The redirection endpoint is a client endpoint used to return tokens and errors
to the client in response to requests to the authorization endpoint.
Essentially, because the authorization endpoint is used by redirecting the
resource owner&rsquo;s user agent to it, the client needs an endpoint that the
authorization server can redirect back to with the response.</p>
<h3 id=token-endpoint>Token Endpoint</h3>
<p>The token endpoint is an authorization server endpoint used to exchange an
authorization grant for an access token. It is used by all grant types except
the implicit grant. While the details of the request to the endpoint depend on
the grant type, the responses are the same in all cases.</p>
<h4 id=successful-response>Successful Response</h4>
<p>If the request is successful, a response will be sent with a <code>200 OK</code> status
code and a JSON body with these fields:</p>
<dl>
<dt>access_token</dt>
<dd>The access token that has been issued.</dd>
<dt>token_type</dt>
<dd>The type of the token that has been issued. As explained in <a href=#access-tokens>Access
Tokens</a>, this will almost always be <code>Bearer</code>.</dd>
<dt>expires_in</dt>
<dd>The lifetime of the access token in seconds. This is optional, but
recommended.</dd>
<dt>refresh_token</dt>
<dd>The refresh token, as explained in <a href=#refresh-tokens>Refresh Tokens</a>. This is
optional.</dd>
<dt>scope</dt>
<dd>The scope of the access token. This is optional if the scope is the same as
what was requested, but in practice it is usually always included.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id=error-response>Error Response</h4>
<p>If the request was unsuccessful, a response will be sent with a <code>400 Bad Request</code> status code (unless specified otherwise) and a JSON body with these
fields:</p>
<dl>
<dt>error</dt>
<dd>An error code. The errors are listed below.</dd>
<dt>error_description</dt>
<dd>A human-readable description providing additional information about the error.
This audience of this description is the client developer, not the resource
owner. This is optional.</dd>
<dt>error_uri</dt>
<dd>This is similar to <code>error_description</code>, but is a URI to a web page with the
information rather than including it in the JSON body itself. It is optional.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The error codes can be one of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>invalid_request</dt>
<dd>The request is missing a parameter, repeats a parameter, includes an
unsupported value for a parameter, includes multiple credentials or multiple
methods of passing credentials, or is otherwise malformed.</dd>
<dt>invalid_client</dt>
<dd>The client authentication failed. The response must use a <code>401 Unauthorized</code>
status code if authentication was attempted using the <code>Authorization</code> header,
and usually that status code will be used regardless of the authentication
method.</dd>
<dt>invalid_grant</dt>
<dd>The grant or refresh token is invalid, or invalid for this client.</dd>
<dt>unauthorized_client</dt>
<dd>The client authenticated successfully, but is not allowed to use this grant
type.</dd>
<dt>unsupported_grant_type</dt>
<dd>The grant type is not supported by the authorization server.</dd>
<dt>invalid_scope</dt>
<dd>The scope is invalid, malformed, or exceeds the scope granted by the resource
owner.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id=summary>Summary</h2>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ve outlined the motivation for OAuth, provided a high-level
summary of how the protocol operates, and detailed the foundational concepts
that the specification is built on. In the next few posts, I will cover the
OAuth grant types in detail, starting with the authorization code grant.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: This post covered the OAuth 2.0 specification as it was originally
written. A number of security best practices have come out of practical
experience of deploying OAuth 2.0, which are being collected in the <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics/>OAuth 2.0
Security Best Current
Practice</a>
draft. While I plan on covering the content of the draft later in the series,
there&rsquo;s a lot of foundational information to go over first. If you are going to
be making use of OAuth before the posts about best current practices, make sure
you read that specification yourself!</p>

<p>Covering the grant types in detail would make this post very long. The
grant types will be covered in later posts in the series.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>You might notice that the <code>scope</code>, <code>redirect_uri</code>, and <code>audience</code> fields
in the example request look a bit strange. This is because parameters are
encoded according to <a href=https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#appendix-B>RFC 6749 Appendix
B</a>. To explain the
<code>scope</code> value: &lsquo;:&rsquo; is encoded as <code>%3A</code> and the space character is encoded as
<code>%20</code>.&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
